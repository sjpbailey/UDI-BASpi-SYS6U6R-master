# Universal Devices BASpi6U6R NodeServer

## Based on the Contemporary Controls BASpi SYS6U6R Controller

* Inputs UOM are set as for, AI-1-3 degrees Fahrenheit, AI-4 btu/h, AI-5 watts & AI-6 cfm.

* It would be great if the Else statement also had a seperate If statement before it ran in the ISY line code. This is also a very diverse platform that is evolving.

### Why

* The purpose of this Nodeserver is for custom control for general Home automation for up to six 6, Binary Outputs and six 6 Universal Inputs. It utilizes the pip bascontrolns module for Contemporary Controls BAS line of DIY Devices. <https://pypi.org/project/bascontrolns/>

* It utilizing the Contemporary Controls BASpi SYS6U6R control Module.
Please see links above for information & configuration of this Device.

* This will be included in a Network series for custom home control for Irrigation, Pool, six 6 car garage door controller, HVAC, VVT, Boiler, Well along with any custom control you create utilizing the bascontrol_ns module.

* This controller sits on a Raspberry Pi. I currently have one running along with Polyglot on the RPI making it a stand alone controller so you can easily add it to your ISY.

* To use as stand alone Use UXTERM: This to Auto and Delay start of Polyglot in terminal on reboot to allow BASpi to Startup First!
Commands: Install; sudo apt-get install xterm
Add working Directory; mkdir -p ~/.config/autostart
Edit Start file; sudo nano ~/.config/autostart/lxterm-autostart.desktop
* UXTERM Auto Start Script

* [Desktop Entry]

* Encoding=UTF-8

* Name=Terminal autostart

* Comment=Start a terminal and list directory

* Exec=/usr/bin/lxterm -e 'cd /home/pi'

* Exec=/usr/bin/lxterm -e 'NODE_ENV=development ./polyglot-v2-linux-armv7â€™

#### Future

* Need to somehow add pulldown for the Universal Inputs. The universal inputs have a large list of configurable UOM's of their own.
Please see configuration quick start link above. On page two, 2 it shows the GUI for the device there you can pick on each universal input to configure its type, a seperate UOM. Also see the viedo below.
